ðŸš¦ TrafficTelligence: Advanced Traffic Volume Estimation with Machine LearningOverviewThis project, developed as part of my internship, is an advanced machine learning system designed to predict traffic volume. Named TrafficTelligence, it uses historical data to forecast traffic with high accuracy, providing valuable insights for urban planning, dynamic traffic management, and commuter guidance. The solution is deployed as a web application using the Flask framework.
Project ArchitectureThe system follows a robust machine learning pipeline:
Data Preprocessing: The raw traffic volume.csv dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and new features are engineered from date and time information.
Model Training: A Random Forest Regressor model is trained on the prepared data.
Model Evaluation: The model's performance is validated on a dedicated test set.
Application Deployment: The trained model is saved and integrated into a Flask web application for real-time predictions.
Key Deliverables & Results
Model Performance:R-squared (R2) Score: 0.9696 (on the test set)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 346.51
Web Application: A functional web interface built with Flask allows users to input various parameters (date, time, weather, etc.) and receive a predicted traffic volume.
